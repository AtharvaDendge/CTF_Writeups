# 🏴‍☠️ CTF Writeups by Atharva Dendge

Welcome to my **CTF Writeups Repository** 🚀  
Here I document my journey through Capture The Flag challenges on platforms like **TryHackMe** and **HackTheBox** 

Each writeup is structured to showcase **real-world attack methodology** — including **enumeration, exploitation, privilege escalation, and key takeaways**.  
This not only reflects my problem-solving skills but also demonstrates practical offensive security techniques.
